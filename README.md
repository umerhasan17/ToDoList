# ToDoList

Exploring creating a simple app using key concepts in a variety of different frameworks

I started with using Model View Controller (MVC) provided by Microsoft ASP.NET. This was useful in that it provided a modular way to write code which is essential for large complex projects. However, due to the overhead of the framework, I moved onto others more commonly known for their prowess at the rapid prototyping stage. 

MVC Features:

•	The application will be accessible on multiple devices.

•	The app will have an easy to use interface for inputting parameters (specified in the data dictionary below) to tasks and will be able to develop a task through natural language processing of a sentence. 

•	Users will be able to enter quick to-dos into a live updating table. 

•	Users will be able to assign reminder dates to to-dos which will appear on the reminders page on the respective date.

•	Suggestions on tasks to do, the app will build up a daily list of to-dos. 

•	Suggestions will be based on time and location parameters.

•	Suggestions will take into account the priority system that the user may choose to assign to each task. 





Currently I'm building a similar application using Django & React. Some of the code to which is presented here. 

The end goal is to not only have a simple todolist but a scheduler based off of the list which can automatically create a timetable for the user to work with.
